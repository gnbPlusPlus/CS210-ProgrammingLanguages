# CS210-ProgrammingLanguages
A collection of the major work I accomplished in this title course at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).

See below for my thoughts on Project One ("12- and 24-hour Clock").

"Summarize the project and what problem it was solving."
  - The objective of the project was to display accurate 12- and 24-hour clock displays to the user, based on their input of time in either 12- or 24-hour format. Beyond the initial input, the user has the continuous options of incrementing the seconds, minutes, and hours by 1. These actions repeat until the user is finished and enters a sentinel value. Although this was the first project, and the clocks neither tick in real-time nor does the program completely validate input, it was the first time I was tasked with creating a class in C++.
    
"What did you do particularly well?"
  - 
"Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?"
  - 
"Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?"
  - Because I felt compelled to use classes for this project, and because we hadn't yet learned about C++ classes in our coursework, I felt particularly overwhelmed with the work. I'd written classes in Java in the previous term, but trying to figure out how to do it in C++ ahead of my coursework felt like a lot at once. I overcame it by working in increments and splitting the work up into "information gathering sessions", meaning that I spent a lot of time preparing for the work to ease my fear of incorrectly completing it. I asked questions of my search engine and found answers in online documentation and Stack Overflow. I looked ahead in my coursework to find examples of how classes looked straight from the textbook. Now that I've learned more about classes, they don't feel so intimidating, and I would've written my code for Project One a little differently (although it fulfills the project just fine). From this experience, I've added the aforementioned online resources to my support network, and I know that referencing my textbooks and notes is always helpful.
    
"What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?"
  -
"How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?"
